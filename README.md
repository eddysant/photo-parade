# photo-slap
electron slideshow application

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eddysant/StringFinder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eddysant/StringFinder)

### raison d'etre:
if you're like me you might have someone in your life who really enjoys taking photos. maybe you, like me, have tens of thousands of photos, if not more, organized in many different folders and you're too lazy to go through them all individually. i have just always found slide show apps to be pretty bad, so hopefully this one is better. 

my issue is that most slide show applications only seem to support one folder at a time or they don't have any support for gifs, or they don't let you delete the photo easily. This application will hopefully remedy all these issues.

### current feature set:
* Open a group of directories and arrow key through photos
* Use the shuffle feature in the menu to mix up the order of the photos
* Support files include: [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".webp", "gif", ".png", ".bmp"]
* Supported videos include (Assuming a compatible encoding): [".webm", ".mp4", ".gifv", ".ogg"] 
* Ability to delete photos (press delete)

### feature sets coming:
* Updated Icons
* Automatic slide show and on screen controls
* Chromecast support
* Social media integration
* Cloud drive support
