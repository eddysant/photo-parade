# photo-slap
electron slideshow application

### raison d'etre:
if you're like me you might have someone in your life who really enjoys taking photos. maybe you, like me, have tens of thousands of photos organized in hundreds of different folders and you're too lazy to go through them all individually. 

my issue is that most slide show applications only seem to support one folder at a time or they don't have any support for gifs, or they don't let you delete the photo easily. This application will hopefully remedy all these issues.

### current feature set:
* Open a group of directories and arrow key through photos
* Use the shuffle feature in the menu to mix up the order of the photos
* Support files include: [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".webp", "gif", ".png", ".bmp"]


### feature sets coming:
* Slide-show controls, second choser
* Support for child sub-directories
* chromecast support
